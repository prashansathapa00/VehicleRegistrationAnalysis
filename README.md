## New Vehicle Registration Analysis 

## Objective
Over 3 million new vehicles were registered in Canada in 2023.
- Thatâ€™s 1 vehicle registration for every 8 person in Canada.
- Automobile business is a big contributor of economy in Canada, and therefore, it is very beneficial for them to analyze the trends in vehicle registrations to plan and prepare for future peaks or downfalls in vehicle demands, seasonal trends, and popular categories.

The reason we are dicussing this now: 
- Although the total registrations has decreased since 2017, but there has been a rise from 2022 to 2023. We could assume that the numbers in registrations will go higher up, as the side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic slowly dies down.

This is why, we opted to analyze the vehicle registration dataset and provide insights on trends, popularities, and possible forecasting.
